# Plagiarism Project, Machine Learning Deployment

This repository contains code and associated files for deploying a plagiarism detector using AWS SageMaker.

## Project Overview

In this project is built  a plagiarism detector that examines a text file and performs binary classification; labels are either *plagiarized* or *not*, depending on how similar that text file is to a provided source text. 

This project will be broken down into three main notebooks:

**Notebook 1: Data Exploration**
* Load in the corpus of plagiarism text data.
* Explore the existing data features and the data distribution.
* This first notebook is **not** required in your final project submission.

**Notebook 2: Feature Engineering**

* Clean and pre-process the text data.
* Define features for comparing the similarity of an answer text and a source text, and extract similarity features.
* "good" features selection, by analyzing the correlations between different features.
* Create train/test `.csv` files that hold the relevant features and class labels for train/test data points.

**Notebook 3: Train and Deploy Your Model in SageMaker**
